# Numerical-Analysis
### _Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. It naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences. Employ MATLAB & Python, I will implement some classical algorithms for solving problems._
