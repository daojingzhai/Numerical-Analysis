# Numerical-Analysis
In this respository, I will use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. 

1. Solving equations and systems of equations
    - Root-finding algorithms
        - Bisection method
        - Fixed point iteration
    - Solving system of linear equations
        - Iterative methods
            - Jacobi method
            - Gauss-Seidel method
            - Successive over-relaxation
