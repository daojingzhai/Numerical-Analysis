# Numerical-Analysis
In this respository, I will implement some classical algorithms for the problems of mathematical analysis. 

1. Root-finding algorithms
    - Bisection method
    - Fixed point iteration
2. Solving systems of equations
    - Gaussian elimination
        - Gauss-Jordan Elimination
        - Gauss-Jordan Elimination Through Pivoting
    - Iterative methods
        - Jacobi method
        - Gauss-Seidel method
        - Successive over-relaxation
3. Interpolation
    - Polynomial interpolation
        - Lagrange interpolation
        - Newtons interpolation
4. Regression
    - Least Squares method
